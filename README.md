               Handwritten Text Recognition Project

                            Overview

Welcome to our Handwritten Text Recognition project! Our team of three students collaborated on this project to develop a system capable of recognizing handwritten text. This README file provides an overview, instructions, and details on how to navigate through our project.

                        Project Structure

Code Files: The project includes Python code files, notably:

main.py: Contains the main code for training the handwritten text recognition model.

preprocessing.py: Handles data preprocessing and image manipulations.

model.py: Defines the architecture of the neural network model used for recognition.

evaluation.py: Evaluates the model's performance and generates metrics.

GUI.py: Contains the code for the graphical user interface for drawing and prediction.

Dependencies: Ensure you have all necessary dependencies installed to run the code successfully. Key dependencies include TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, and Matplotlib. Check the requirements.txt file for the complete list.

Datasets: We used multiple handwritten text datasets, including [Dataset Name] and [Dataset Name]. These datasets contain handwritten text samples used for training and testing the model.
           
                      Getting Started

              To run the project, follow these steps:

Installation: Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.

Data Preparation: Download the datasets used for training and testing. Preprocess the data by running the preprocessing.py file.

Model Training: Run the main.py file to train the handwritten text recognition model. Adjust hyperparameters as needed.

Model Evaluation: Utilize the evaluation.py file to evaluate the model's performance on test data and generate metrics such as accuracy and character error rate (CER).

User Interface: Run the GUI.py file to open the graphical user interface, where users can draw handwritten text for prediction using the trained model.
